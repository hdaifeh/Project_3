implementation of a completed orders page in PHP:
<?php
session_start();

require_once 'pdo_connect.php';

// Get all completed orders from the database
$stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE completed = 1");
$orders = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Completed Orders</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Completed Orders</h1>

  <?php if (count($orders) > 0): ?>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Order ID</th>
        <th>Customer Name</th>
        <th>Customer Email</th>
        <th>Customer Address</th>
        <th>Total Price</th>
      </tr>
      <?php foreach ($orders as $order): ?>
        <tr>
          <td><?= $order['id'] ?></td>

          <td><?= $order['customer_address'] ?></td>
          <td><?=
            number_format($order['total_price'], 2) // displays the total price with 2 decimal places
          ?></td>
        </tr>
      <?php endforeach; ?>
    </table>
  <?php else: ?>
    <p>No completed orders found.</p>
  <?php endif; ?>

///
 database table called "orders" with columns for "id", "customer_name", "customer_email", "customer_address", "total_price", and "completed" (which should be a boolean value indicating whether the order has been completed). You may need to adjust the SQL query and column names in the PHP code to match your specific database schema.
